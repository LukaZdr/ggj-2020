# Global Game Jam 2020
Manual labor is tough job and exhaustive at last when it's on a ship. But being forced to work on the cursed M.S. Shithole is the worst.

Now it's up to you. Do you manage to keep this wreak afloat?
Keep an eye on the water pressure, is it too high? Release some pent up gas by turning the valve. If gas is leaking get your Phatboi and plug the holes. Stop enjoyig the shower and get some bolts up in these holes!
Without pressure you can forget about your vegan pumpkin cappuccino, get your shovel and shove up some coal inside of the boiler.
Hurry up, the time is against you!

## Manuals:
* get close to your tools and squeeze the according hand to pick it up
* while placing the shovel dip the blade in the coal pile and carry carefully in the boiler
* bolts you can place with your hands or shoot them with your Boltgun
